Creating a pull request is a common workflow in collaborative software development, particularly when using version control systems like Git. The original repository is https://github.com/eyahi/OOP-Assignment-300L-NUN.git and you do not have write access to it, you will need to make a pull request for me to see your work. The steps to do pull request are given below

1. Fork the Repository:

If you don't have write access to the original repository, you need to fork it. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repository.git
cd your-forked-repository

Create a new branch for your changes. It's a good practice to create a branch for each feature or bug fix.

Make the necessary changes to the codebase on your local machine. In the changes add your code to the right assignment, like add to Assignment 1 folder 

5. Commit Changes:

Once you've made your changes, commit them to your local branch.

git add .
git commit -m "Your name’s assignment"

6. Push Changes:

Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

git push origin branch-name

Although, I am fine with using the main branch

 7. Create a Pull Request:

Go to your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a notification prompting you to create a pull request. If not, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click on "New Pull Request."

Choose the base repository (the original repository) and the branch you want to merge into. Also, choose your forked repository and the branch with your changes.

8. Provide Details:

Write a clear and concise title and description for your pull request. Explain the purpose of your changes.

9. Submit Pull Request:

Click the "Create Pull Request" button to submit your pull request. This will notify the maintainers of the original repository that you have changes you'd like them to review.

10. Discussion and Changes:

Be prepared for feedback and discussion. Make the necessary changes locally, commit them, and push them to your branch.

Repeat this process until your changes are approved and merged into the original repository.
